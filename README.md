# CHRONOS
MELS 3D LABS KINEMATICS
THE IDEA FOR MELS 3D LABS CHRONOS, A 4 AXIS 3D PRINTER KINEMATICS, WAS CONCIEVED ON EARLY 2021. DESIGNED IN 10/27/2022 AND DIAGRAMS PUBLISHED ON GITHUB ON 7/16/2023
CHRONOS USES INTERNAL RING GEAR FOR THE ARC AXIS MOVEMENTS OF X AND Y WITH A THETA AXIS FOR A TOOL HEAD.
PUBLISHING THE KINEMATICS AS A PROOF OF PRIOR ART SEARCH AND TO PRESERVE THE CREDIT OF THE KINEMATICS.


THE PRINTER CONSISTS OF AXES
X
Y
Z
THETA AXIS

AS 3D Scanner Kinematics :
The biggest advantage of chronos kinematics with a theta axis is that a physical model can be scanned perfectly from all sides and angles. Hence allowing a 3D printer to be a 3D scanner as well with a tool head swap.
